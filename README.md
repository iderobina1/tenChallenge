## Technologies Used

This project is powered by Node.js v16.20.1, utilizes inquirer v8.2.4 (node package manager), and file system module (node package manager). 

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone: https://github.com/iderobina1/tenChallenge

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.


5. To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.


## Usage Information

To run this application, use the command line to navigate to the directory of the application, install all dependencies (npm i), then type the command node index.js. You will then be taken through a series of questions. Once all questions have been answered properly, a message will display to the command line telling you your logo has been generated. Find your new logo in the newly generated SVG file.
